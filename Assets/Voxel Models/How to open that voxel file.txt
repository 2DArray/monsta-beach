dude.vox is a MagicaVoxel file.

MagicaVoxel is a free voxel editor made by ephtracy.  It's pretty fucking rad, and you should try it some time.

It lets you build voxel models with specialized tools, and then you can export them as 3D models - it's much faster for me to make a prop in MagicaVoxel than in a traditional modeling program...but on the other hand, the voxel style can be limiting in certain gamedev situations.  I feel like it's a really valuable piece of software to have.

Also I'm not affiliated with it, I just think it's really cool
